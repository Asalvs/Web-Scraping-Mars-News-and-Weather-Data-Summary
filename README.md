# Web-scraping

I used web scraping techniques to extract information about Mars from two different sources. In Part 1, I scraped the Mars News website to extract the titles and preview text of news articles. I used Beautiful Soup to extract text elements from the website, and stored the results in Python data structures, including dictionaries and lists.

In Part 2, I scraped and analyzed Mars weather data from the Mars Temperature Data Site. I used automated browsing to visit the website and identify which elements to scrape. Then, I extracted the data using Beautiful Soup and Pandas, cleaned and manipulated the data, and performed some basic analysis, such as calculating summary statistics and creating visualizations. This analysis help you understand the climate patterns on Mars and inform future missions to the planet.
